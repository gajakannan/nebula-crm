2. ✅ Clarified domain events for audit, not event sourcing (Backend Developer)
3. ✅ Deferred JWT token storage to Architect/Security with decision location guidance (Frontend Developer)
4. ✅ Clarified unit test ownership (devs own, QE validates) (Quality Engineer)
5. ✅ Added "no direct database access from API layer" guardrail (Backend Developer)
6. ✅ Added "error boundary per route" requirement (Frontend Developer)
7. ✅ Specified test plan centralization in `planning-mds/testing/` (Quality Engineer)

## Agent Status Summary

### Fully Complete (2 agents)
- **Product Manager** - references/ and scripts/ content created

### SKILL.md & README.md Complete (8 agents)
Reference content and scripts can be created incrementally as needed:
- Backend Developer
- Frontend Developer
- Quality Engineer
- DevOps
- Security
- Code Reviewer
- Technical Writer
- Blogger

**Note:** SKILL.md and README.md provide sufficient guidance to start using these agents immediately. Reference content and scripts are enhancements that can be added over time based on real usage patterns.

## What's Ready to Use

### ✅ Immediate Use
All 10 agents can be used immediately for BrokerHub development:
1. Product Manager can define requirements (Phase A)
2. Architect can design system (Phase B)
3. Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, QE can implement and test (Phase C)
4. Security can review design and implementation
5. Code Reviewer can review pull requests

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Start Building BrokerHub
You now have everything needed to start implementing BrokerHub:
1. Use **Product Manager** to define Phase A requirements
2. Use **Architect** to design Phase B technical specs
3. Use **Backend Developer**, **Frontend Developer**, and **Quality Engineer** to implement Phase C
4. Use supporting agents (Security, Code Reviewer, DevOps, etc.) as needed

### Option 2: Add Reference Content
Create reference content incrementally as you encounter needs:
- Backend Developer references (dotnet-best-practices.md, clean-architecture-guide.md, etc.)
- Frontend Developer references (react-best-practices.md, typescript-patterns.md, etc.)
- Quality Engineer references (e2e-testing-guide.md, performance-testing-guide.md, etc.)
- And so on...

### Option 3: Add Automation Scripts
Create scripts as automation needs arise:
- Backend scaffolding (scaffold-usecase.py, scaffold-entity.py)
- Frontend scaffolding (scaffold-component.py, scaffold-page.py)
- Testing scripts (run-all-tests.sh, generate-coverage-report.sh)
- And so on...

---

## Recommendation

**Start building BrokerHub now!**

All 10 agents are fully specified and ready to use. The reference content and scripts are nice-to-haves that can be added incrementally based on real needs encountered during development.

The SKILL.md and README.md files provide comprehensive guidance that is immediately actionable.
