# Action: Feature

## User Intent

Build a single feature as a complete vertical slice (backend + frontend + tests + deployability checks) that can be deployed and tested independently. Ideal for incremental delivery.

## Agent Flow

```
Architect (Implementation Orchestration)
  ↓
(Backend Developer + Frontend Developer + AI Engineer [if AI scope] + Quality Engineer + DevOps)
  ↓ [Parallel Implementation]
[SELF-REVIEW GATE: Each agent validates their work]
  ↓
Code Reviewer + Security
  ↓ [Parallel Reviews]
[Review Gate: resolve critical findings]
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews and approves]
  ↓
Feature Complete
```

**Flow Type:** Mixed (architect-led orchestration kickoff, parallel implementation including deployability checks, parallel code+security reviews, single approval gate; AI Engineer runs when feature includes AI scope)

---

## Runtime Execution Boundary

- The builder runtime orchestrates feature flow and gates; keep it stack-agnostic.
- Stack-specific compile/test/lint/security execution must run in application runtime containers (or CI jobs built from those container definitions).
- Review and approval decisions must cite evidence produced by those application runtime executions.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Architect-Led Feature Assembly Planning

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Architect agent** by reading `agents/architect/SKILL.md`
2. **Read context:**
   - Feature stories in `planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/F{NNNN}-S{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
   - `planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` scope and constraints
   - `planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - `planning-mds/api/` contracts for this feature
3. **Produce feature assembly plan:**
   - Required backend/frontend/AI changes for this feature only
   - Integration checkpoints and dependency order
   - Test and release checklist for the vertical slice
4. **Output artifact:**
   - `planning-mds/architecture/feature-assembly-plan.md` (use `agents/templates/feature-assembly-plan-template.md`)

**Completion Criteria for Step 0:**
- [ ] Feature assembly plan exists
- [ ] Feature scope and handoffs are explicit
- [ ] Integration/test checkpoints defined

---

### Step 0.5: Assembly Plan Validation

**Execution Instructions:**

Validate the feature assembly plan before parallel implementation:

- [ ] Scope split matches feature story requirements
- [ ] Dependencies between agents are identified
- [ ] Integration checkpoints are feasible
- [ ] No missing or conflicting artifact ownership

Validator:
- Code Reviewer or a second Architect review (lightweight checklist is sufficient)

---

### Step 1: Parallel Feature Implementation

**Execution Instructions:**

Execute these agents **in parallel** for the specific feature. Run AI Engineer when the feature touches `neuron/`, LLM workflows, prompts, or MCP.

**AI Scope Checklist — include AI Engineer if ANY apply:**
- [ ] Story mentions LLM, AI, or machine learning behavior
- [ ] Story requires MCP server/tool/resource work
- [ ] Story involves prompts, agent behavior, or tool orchestration
- [ ] Story changes files under `neuron/`
- [ ] Story requires model selection, cost controls, or guardrails

## Validation Criteria

**Overall Feature Action Success:**
- [ ] Feature assembly plan created and followed
- [ ] Feature is complete vertical slice (backend + frontend + tests + DevOps deployability checks + AI when in scope)
- [ ] All feature tests passing in application runtime containers
- [ ] AI tests passing (if AI scope) in AI runtime container
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Security review approved
- [ ] All feature acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Feature can be deployed independently
- [ ] User decision recorded per gate rules

---

## Prerequisites

Before running feature action:
- [ ] Plan action completed for this feature
- [ ] Feature has clear user stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Feature scope is small (2-5 days of work)
- [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md exists
- [ ] AI scope is explicit (if feature includes AI behavior)
- [ ] User is available for approval

---

## Vertical Slicing Best Practices

### What Makes a Good Vertical Slice?

1. **Complete:** Includes backend, frontend, tests, deployability checks, and AI layer changes when AI scope exists
2. **Deployable:** Can be released independently
3. **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria
4. **Small:** Can be completed in 2-5 days
5. **Valuable:** Delivers user value on its own

### Good Feature Examples
- ✅ "View customer list with pagination"
- ✅ "Create new order with required fields"
- ✅ "Search accounts by name"
- ✅ "View activity timeline for an account"

### Bad Feature Examples (Too Large - Break Down!)
- ❌ "Build entire customer management module"
- ❌ "Implement full order processing workflow"
- ❌ "Complete onboarding process"

### Not Vertical Slices
- ❌ "Create all database tables" (not vertical)
- ❌ "Build all backend APIs" (not vertical)
- ❌ "Create all forms" (not vertical)

---

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Customer List Feature
```
User: "Run the feature action for customer list with pagination"

Agent Runtime: [Reads feature.md]
Agent Runtime: "I'll implement the customer list feature as a vertical slice..."

[Step 0: Feature assembly planning]
  Architect:
    - Feature scope and dependencies mapped
    - Ownership assigned for backend/frontend/AI/test tasks

[Step 1: Parallel implementation]
  Backend Developer:
    - GET /api/customers endpoint with pagination
    - CustomerService.ListAsync method
    - Unit tests for service
    - Integration tests for endpoint

  Frontend Developer:
    - CustomerList component
    - TanStack Query hook for fetching customers
    - Pagination controls
    - Component tests

  Quality Engineer:
    - E2E test: View customer list
    - E2E test: Navigate pages
    - Test plan for customer list

  DevOps:
    - Container smoke test for feature runtime
    - Validate env var and compose changes
    - Record deployability evidence

[Step 2: Self-review - all pass]

[Step 3: Parallel reviews]
Agent Runtime: "Code and security reviews complete. Results:
  - Vertical slice: Complete
  - Issues: 2 medium (naming conventions)
  - Security findings: 0 critical, 0 high, 1 low
  - Test coverage: 85%
  - Acceptance criteria: All met
  - Recommendation: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS"

[Step 4: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Feature review complete. Do you approve? (approve/fix issues/reject)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Feature complete! Customer list with pagination ready to merge."
```

### Scenario 2: Iteration After Rejection
```
User: "Run the feature action for customer search"

[Steps 0.5-3 execute]

[Step 4: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Feature review results:
  - Issues: 1 critical (missing authorization check)
  - Recommendation: FIX CRITICAL"

User: "fix critical"

Agent Runtime: "Fixing authorization check..."
[Backend Developer adds authorization]

[Step 3: Re-review]
Agent Runtime: "Code and security reviews updated. Results:
  - Authorization: Fixed
  - Security status: PASS
  - Recommendation: APPROVED"

[Step 4: Re-approval]
Agent Runtime: "Do you approve now?"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Feature complete!"
```

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [plan action](./plan.md) - Plan the feature
- **Alternative:** [build action](./build.md) - Build multiple features together
- **After:** [document action](./document.md) - Document the feature
- **After:** [blog action](./blog.md) - Blog about the feature

---

## Notes

- Feature action is the **recommended way** to build incrementally
- Each feature should be merged to main after approval
- Features can build on each other (dependencies allowed)
- Prefer small, frequent features over large batches
- Feature action ensures true vertical slicing discipline
- Security review is part of the feature action (run `review` action separately for deeper audit scope when needed)
- DevOps deployability check is included; use `build` action for broader infra redesign across multiple features
- Critical findings block approval; high findings require explicit mitigation justification if approved
