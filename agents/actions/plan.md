# Action: Plan

## User Intent

Complete planning phase (Phase A + B) by defining product requirements and technical architecture with approval gates between phases.

## Agent Flow

```
Product Manager (Phase A)
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews requirements]

```

**Flow Type:** Sequential with approval gates

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Execute Product Manager (Phase A)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Product Manager agent** by reading `agents/product-manager/SKILL.md`

2. **Read required context:**
   - `planning-mds/INCEPTION.md` (Sections 0-2 for baseline context)
   - `planning-mds/domain/` (domain glossary, if exists)

3. **Execute Product Manager responsibilities:**
   - Define vision and explicit non-goals
   - Create personas representing target users
   - Decompose vision into epics and features
   - Write user stories with clear acceptance criteria
   - Specify screen list and responsibilities
   - Map key workflows across screens

4. **Produce outputs:**
   - Update `planning-mds/INCEPTION.md` Section 3 (complete, no TODOs)
   - Create `planning-mds/examples/personas/*.md` (if detailed personas needed)
   - Create `planning-mds/features/*.md` (if detailed feature specs are needed)
   - Create `planning-mds/stories/` content (if detailed stories needed)

5. **Validate Phase A outputs:**
   - [ ] Vision and non-goals documented
   - [ ] Personas defined
   - [ ] Features listed with MVP prioritization
   - [ ] User stories have acceptance criteria
   - [ ] Screen responsibilities specified
   - [ ] No invented business rules (all traced to user needs)
   - [ ] No TODOs remain in Section 3

**Phase A Outputs:**
- `planning-mds/INCEPTION.md` Section 3 (complete)
- `planning-mds/examples/personas/` (optional)
- `planning-mds/features/` (optional)
- `planning-mds/stories/` (optional)

---

### Step 1.5: CLARIFICATION GATE (Requirements Clarification)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Review Phase A outputs for underspecified areas:**

   Read through all Phase A deliverables and identify:
   - Vague acceptance criteria (no numbers, no specifics)
   - Ambiguous language ("should", "might", "probably", "easy", "fast", "secure")
   - Missing edge cases or error scenarios
   - Undefined dependencies
   - Unstated assumptions
   - Features without clear success criteria

2. **Identify specific issues:**

   Create a list of underspecified areas with specific questions:

   ```markdown
   ## Requirements Clarification Needed

   ### Vague Acceptance Criteria

   **Story:** "Customer search should be fast"
   **Issue:** "Fast" is not measurable
   **Questions:**
   - How fast is "fast"? (< 200ms? < 1s? < 5s?)
   - For how many results? (100? 1000? 10000?)
   - What's acceptable if it's slower?

   **Story:** "Users can upload documents"
   **Issues:** Missing specifications
   **Questions:**
   - What file types allowed? (PDF, images, Office docs, all?)
   - Max file size? (1MB? 10MB? 100MB?)
   - What happens if upload fails? (retry? error message?)
   - Where are files stored? (database? blob storage?)
   - Virus scanning required?

   ### Ambiguous Language

   **Story:** "Dashboard should be intuitive"
   **Issue:** "Intuitive" is subjective
   **Questions:**
   - What specific widgets/data on dashboard?
   - What actions can users take from dashboard?
   - What defines "success" for this dashboard?

   ### Missing Edge Cases

   **Feature:** "Customer list with pagination"
   **Questions:**
   - What happens with empty list (no customers)?
   - Default page size? (10? 20? 50?)
   - Max page size?
   - What happens on last page with < full page?

   ### Unstated Assumptions

   **Feature:** "Email notifications"
   **Questions:**
   - Who sends emails? (system? specific user?)
   - When are emails sent? (immediate? batched?)
   - What if email fails to send?
   - Unsubscribe option required?
   ```

3. **Ask user for clarifications:**

   Present the clarification questions to the user:

   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Requirements Clarification Needed
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Phase A requirements have [count] underspecified areas that
   need clarification before proceeding to architecture design.

   [List questions by category]

   Please provide answers to these questions, or indicate if
   any should be deferred to architecture phase.
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

4. **Update Phase A outputs with clarifications:**

   - Update user stories with specific, quantified acceptance criteria
   - Remove ambiguous language
   - Add edge cases and error scenarios
   - Document assumptions explicitly
   - Add dependencies to stories

5. **Validate clarifications are complete:**

   **Testability Check:**
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
   - [ ] No ambiguous words remain ("should" → "must", "fast" → "< 200ms")
   - [ ] All performance requirements quantified
   - [ ] Error scenarios specified for each story
   - [ ] Edge cases identified

   **Completeness Check:**
   - [ ] All dependencies documented
   - [ ] All assumptions explicit
   - [ ] File upload/download specs complete (types, sizes, errors)
   - [ ] Notification specs complete (when, who, how, failures)
   - [ ] Search/filter specs complete (fields, operators, performance)

**Anti-Patterns to Catch:**

Banned words that indicate vagueness:
- ❌ "should", "might", "probably", "usually", "generally"
- ❌ "easy", "simple", "intuitive", "user-friendly"
- ❌ "fast", "quick", "slow", "performant", "responsive"
- ❌ "secure", "safe", "protected" (without specifics)
- ❌ "scalable", "flexible", "robust" (without metrics)

Replace with:
- ✅ "must" (requirement), "may" (optional)
- ✅ Specific metrics ("< 200ms p95", "≥ 80% success rate")
- ✅ Explicit error handling ("show error: 'File too large'")
- ✅ Quantified criteria ("support 10,000 concurrent users")

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] All underspecified areas identified
- [ ] User provided clarifications
- [ ] Phase A outputs updated with specifics
- [ ] No ambiguous language remains
- [ ] All acceptance criteria testable
- [ ] Edge cases and errors documented

**If Clarifications Complete:**
- Proceed to Step 2 (Approval Gate)

**If User Defers Some Questions:**
- Document as "Architect to decide" with rationale
- Proceed to Step 2

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Plan New Feature
```
User: "Run the plan action for customer management"

Agent Runtime: [Reads plan.md]
Agent Runtime: "I'll execute Step 1: Product Manager for Phase A..."

[Product Manager executes - defines personas, stories, screens for customer management]

Agent Runtime: "Phase A complete. Outputs:
  - 2 personas (Distribution Manager, Customer Relationship Manager)
  - 5 features (Customer CRUD, Search, Activity Timeline)
  - 15 user stories with acceptance criteria
  - 4 screens (List, Detail, Create/Edit, Search)

Do you approve Phase A? (approve/reject/request changes)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Proceeding to Step 3: Architect for Phase B..."

[Architect executes - designs data model, API, authorization, workflows]

Agent Runtime: "Phase B complete. Outputs:
  - Data model: Customer entity with relationships
  - API: 7 endpoints defined
  - Authorization: ABAC policies for customer operations
  - Patterns followed: All SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md patterns applied

Do you approve Phase B? (approve/reject/request changes)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Plan action complete! Ready for build action."
```

### Scenario 2: Iteration on Phase A
```
User: "Run the plan action for order processing workflow"

[Phase A executes]

Agent Runtime: "Phase A complete. Do you approve?"

User: "reject - the personas don't match our actual users"

Agent Runtime: "What feedback do you have? What should be changed?"

User: "Add a persona for Enterprise Account Managers, they're a key user"

Agent Runtime: "Understood. Iterating on Phase A with your feedback..."

[Product Manager updates personas]

Agent Runtime: "Phase A updated. New outputs:
  - 3 personas (added Enterprise Account Manager)
  - Stories updated to reflect enterprise account needs

Do you approve Phase A now? (approve/reject/request changes)"

User: "approve"

[Continues to Phase B...]
```

---

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [init action](./init.md) - Bootstrap project structure
- **Next:** [build action](./build.md) - Implement the plan (all features)
- **Next:** [feature action](./feature.md) - Implement incrementally (one feature)
- **Alternative:** [validate action](./validate.md) - Validate architecture before building

---

## Notes

- Plan action can be run for the entire project or individual features
- Approval gates are mandatory - cannot skip to Phase B without Phase A approval
- If requirements change mid-project, re-run plan action for affected features
- Both agents use templates from `agents/templates/` for consistency
- Architect must reference SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md to ensure pattern compliance
