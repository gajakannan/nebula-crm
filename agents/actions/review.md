# Action: Review

## User Intent

Perform comprehensive code quality and security review on implemented features or the entire codebase with approval gates.

## Agent Flow

```
(Code Reviewer + Security)
  ↓ [Parallel Reviews]
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews findings and decides next steps]
  ↓
Review Complete
```

**Flow Type:** Parallel reviews with single approval gate

---

## Runtime Execution Boundary

- The builder runtime orchestrates review flow and gate decisions; it remains stack-agnostic.
- Stack-specific compile/test/lint/security execution must run in application runtime containers (or CI jobs built from those container definitions).
- Review gate decisions must reference evidence generated from those application runtime executions.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Parallel Reviews

**Execution Instructions:**

Execute these review agents **in parallel**:

#### 1a. Code Reviewer
1. **Activate Code Reviewer agent** by reading `agents/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`

2. **Read context:**
   - Source code (backend, frontend, and `neuron/` when AI scope exists)
   - Test suites
   - Application runtime validation outputs (test, lint, SAST, dependency scan reports)
   - `planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (requirements and architecture)
   - `planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - User stories with acceptance criteria

3. **Execute code review:**
   - Review code structure and organization
   - Check SOLID principles adherence
   - Validate clean architecture boundaries
   - Review test coverage and quality
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns
   - Check naming conventions and readability
   - Validate acceptance criteria mapping
   - Review error handling patterns
   - Check for over-engineering or under-engineering
   - Validate SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md compliance

4. **Produce code review report:**
   ```markdown

   Detailed Reports:
   - Code Quality Review: [link/location]
   - Security Review: [link/location]
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

2. **Compute gate state from combined findings:**
   ```
   total_critical = code_critical + security_critical
   total_high = code_high + security_high
   total_medium = code_medium + security_medium
   total_low = code_low + security_low

   IF total_critical > 0:
     STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED
     OPTIONS: ["Fix Critical", "Reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: false

   ELSE IF total_high > 0:
     STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING
     OPTIONS: ["Fix All High (Recommended)", "Approve with Justification", "Reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true (requires justification)

   ELSE:
     STATUS: ✓ ACCEPTABLE
     OPTIONS: ["Approve", "Fix Issues Anyway", "Reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true
   ```

3. **Present approval checklist:**
   ```
   Review Approval Checklist:
   - [ ] No critical code quality issues
   - [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
   - [ ] High-severity issues fixed OR approved with mitigation justification
   - [ ] OWASP Top 10 compliance acceptable
   - [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md followed
   - [ ] Test/scan evidence from application runtime containers attached
   - [ ] Authorization correctly implemented
   - [ ] Audit logging complete
   ```

4. **Present gate options by state:**
   - **If BLOCKED (critical findings exist):**
     - Options: `"fix critical"`, `"reject"`
     - Do not present any approve option.
   - **If WARNING (no critical, one or more high):**
     - Options: `"fix all high"`, `"approve with justification"`, `"reject"`
   - **If ACCEPTABLE (no critical/high):**
     - Options: `"approve"`, `"fix issues anyway"`, `"reject"`

5. **Handle user response:**
   - **If "fix critical":**
     - Identify critical issues (code + security)
     - Developers fix critical issues
     - Return to Step 1 (re-run reviews)

   - **If "fix all high" or "fix issues anyway":**
     - Identify selected issues
     - Developers fix issues
     - Return to Step 1 (re-run reviews)

   - **If "approve with justification":**
     - Capture explicit mitigation justification for remaining high issues
     - Log decision and mitigation plan
     - Proceed to Step 3 (Review Complete)

   - **If "approve":**
     - Proceed to Step 3 (Review Complete)

   - **If "reject":**
     - Capture feedback
     - Return to implementation
     - Full rebuild required

   - **If user input is not in the current state's allowed options:**
     - Do not transition
     - Re-present current state and allowed options

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Both reviews completed
- [ ] Combined critical issues = 0 before approval is enabled
- [ ] Any high-issue approval includes explicit mitigation justification
- [ ] User decision logged with rationale when required

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Clean Review with Approval
```
User: "Run the review action on the customer feature"

[Step 1: Parallel reviews]
Code Reviewer:
  - No critical issues
  - 2 medium issues (naming conventions)
  - Test coverage: 87%
  - Recommendation: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

Security:
  - No vulnerabilities
  - OWASP Top 10: 10/10 passed
  - Authorization: Correct
  - Recommendation: PASS

[Step 2: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Review complete.
  Code: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS (2 medium issues)
  Security: PASS

  Do you want to take action? (approve/fix issues anyway/reject)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Review approved! Code ready to merge."
```

### Scenario 2: Critical Security Issue
```
User: "Run the review action on order processing workflow"

[Step 1: Parallel reviews]
Code Reviewer:
  - 1 high issue (missing error handling)
  - Recommendation: APPROVED WITH HIGH-PRIORITY FIXES

Security:
  - 1 CRITICAL issue (SQL injection vulnerability in search)
  - 2 high issues (missing authorization checks)
  - Recommendation: FIX CRITICAL

[Step 2: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Review complete.
  Code: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS
  Security: FAIL (1 critical vulnerability)

  CRITICAL: SQL injection in customer search endpoint
  Location: CustomerController.cs:45
  Must fix before deployment!

  What action? (fix critical/reject)"

User: "fix critical"

Agent Runtime: "Fixing SQL injection vulnerability..."
[Backend Developer fixes using parameterized queries]

Agent Runtime: "Issue fixed. Running security review again..."
[Security re-reviews]

Agent Runtime: "Security review: WARNING. Critical issue resolved; 2 high issues remain.
  What action? (fix all high/approve with justification/reject)"

User: "approve with justification"

Agent Runtime: "Justification recorded. Review approved with mitigation plan."
```

---

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [build action](./build.md) or [feature action](./feature.md) - Implement first
- **After:** [document action](./document.md) - Document after approval
- **Part of:** [build action](./build.md) includes review as Phase 2

---

## Notes

- Review action can be run on any scope (feature, PR, full codebase)
- Both reviews run in parallel for efficiency
- Critical issues must be fixed before approval
- Review reports should be saved for tracking
- Reviews can be re-run after changes
- User has final decision on approval within gate constraints (agents recommend, user decides)
- Automated tools can supplement but not replace agent reviews
