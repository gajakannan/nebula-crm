## Example 1: Complete Broker Module Specification

This example shows a complete module specification including entity design, API contracts, authorization policies, and audit requirements.

### Broker Entity Specification

**Table Name:** `Brokers`

**Description:** Represents an insurance broker or brokerage firm that submits business to carriers.

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints | Default | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Id | Guid | PK, NOT NULL | NewGuid() | Unique identifier |
| Name | string(255) | NOT NULL, INDEX | - | Broker legal name (DBA or registered name) |
| LicenseNumber | string(50) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | - | State-issued broker license number |
| State | string(2) | NOT NULL, FK → States | - | Licensed state (US state code: CA, NY, TX, etc.) |
| TaxId | string(20) | NULL | - | Federal Tax ID (EIN) - encrypted at rest |
| Email | string(255) | NULL | - | Primary contact email |
| Phone | string(20) | NULL | - | Primary contact phone (format: +1-555-555-5555) |
| Address | string(500) | NULL | - | Physical mailing address |
| Website | string(255) | NULL | - | Broker website URL |
| ParentBrokerId | Guid | NULL, FK → Brokers | - | For broker hierarchies (MGA → sub-broker) |
| Status | string(20) | NOT NULL | 'Active' | Active, Inactive, Suspended |
| InternalNotes | string(2000) | NULL | - | Internal-only notes (not visible to brokers) |
| CreatedAt | DateTime | NOT NULL | UtcNow | UTC timestamp of creation |
| CreatedBy | Guid | NOT NULL, FK → Users | - | User who created the record |
| UpdatedAt | DateTime | NOT NULL | UtcNow | UTC timestamp of last update |
| UpdatedBy | Guid | NOT NULL, FK → Users | - | User who last updated the record |
| DeletedAt | DateTime | NULL | - | Soft delete timestamp (NULL = active) |

#### Relationships

- **One-to-Many:** Broker → Contacts (one broker has many contact persons)
  - Cascade: Soft delete (when broker soft-deleted, contacts also soft-deleted)
- **One-to-Many:** Broker → Submissions (one broker submits many submissions)
  - Cascade: Restrict (cannot delete broker with active submissions)
- **One-to-Many:** Broker → Accounts (one broker manages many accounts/insureds)
  - Cascade: Restrict (cannot delete broker with active accounts)
- **Self-Referencing:** Broker → ParentBroker (for MGA/sub-broker hierarchies)
  - Cascade: Set NULL (if parent deleted, child becomes top-level broker)
- **Many-to-One:** Broker → States (reference data)

#### Indexes

- `PK_Brokers_Id` (PRIMARY KEY, clustered)
- `IX_Brokers_LicenseNumber` (UNIQUE, non-clustered)
- `IX_Brokers_Name` (non-clustered, for search/filter)
- `IX_Brokers_State` (non-clustered, for filtering by state)
- `IX_Brokers_Status` (non-clustered, for filtering active/inactive)
- `IX_Brokers_ParentBrokerId` (non-clustered, for hierarchy queries)
- `IX_Brokers_DeletedAt` (partial index WHERE DeletedAt IS NULL, for active records)

#### Audit Requirements

All mutations (Create, Update, Soft Delete) must generate `ActivityTimelineEvent`:

- **BrokerCreated**: When new broker added
- **BrokerUpdated**: When any field modified (include changed fields in payload)
- **BrokerDeleted**: When soft-deleted (sets DeletedAt timestamp)
- **BrokerRestored**: When un-deleted (clears DeletedAt)

Timeline events include:
```json
{
  "entityType": "Broker",
  "entityId": "guid-here",
  "eventType": "BrokerCreated",
  "userId": "user-guid",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-31T10:30:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "name": "Acme Insurance Brokers",
    "licenseNumber": "CA-12345",
    "state": "CA"
  }
}
```

#### Seed Data Strategy

- **No broker seed data** (all broker records are user-created)
- **Reference data seeded**: `States` table populated with 50 US states + DC
- **Test data**: Faker-generated brokers for development/testing environments only

### Broker Authorization Policies

Casbin ABAC policies for Broker module.

```csv
# Distribution users can create, read, update brokers
p, Distribution, Broker, Create, allow
p, Distribution, Broker, Read, allow
p, Distribution, Broker, Update, allow

# Distribution users can soft-delete brokers (but not hard delete)
p, Distribution, Broker, Delete, allow

# Underwriters can read brokers but not modify
p, Underwriter, Broker, Read, allow

# Admins can do everything with brokers
p, Admin, Broker, *, allow

# System administrators can restore soft-deleted brokers
p, Admin, Broker, Restore, allow
```

**Authorization Enforcement:**
- All API endpoints check Casbin policies before executing operations
- Subject attributes extracted from JWT token (roles claim)
- Resource type = "Broker"
- Action = Create, Read, Update, Delete

## Example 2: Complete Submission Workflow Specification

This example shows a complete workflow with state machine, transitions, validation, authorization, and error handling.

### Submission Entity

**Table Name:** `Submissions`

#### Key Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Id | Guid | PK | Unique identifier |
| SubmissionNumber | string(50) | UNIQUE, NOT NULL | Human-readable ID (e.g., SUB-2026-001234) |
| BrokerId | Guid | FK → Brokers, NOT NULL | Broker who submitted |
| AccountId | Guid | FK → Accounts, NULL | Linked account/insured |
| InsuredName | string(255) | NOT NULL | Name of insured entity |
| CoverageType | string(50) | NOT NULL | GL, WC, Property, Auto, etc. |
| ProgramId | Guid | FK → Programs, NULL | Insurance program |
| EffectiveDate | Date | NOT NULL | Requested policy effective date |
| ExpirationDate | Date | NOT NULL | Requested policy expiration date |
| EstimatedPremium | decimal(18,2) | NULL | Broker's estimated premium |
| Status | string(50) | NOT NULL | Current workflow status |
| AssignedUnderwriterId | Guid | FK → Users, NULL | Underwriter assigned |
| CreatedAt | DateTime | NOT NULL | Submission received timestamp |
| CreatedBy | Guid | FK → Users, NOT NULL | User who created |
| UpdatedAt | DateTime | NOT NULL | Last update timestamp |
| UpdatedBy | Guid | FK → Users, NOT NULL | User who last updated |

### Submission Workflow State Machine

**States:**
1. **Received** - Initial state when submission created
2. **Triaging** - Distribution team reviewing for completeness
3. **WaitingOnBroker** - Missing information, awaiting broker response
4. **ReadyForUWReview** - Complete, ready for underwriter assignment
5. **InReview** - Underwriter actively reviewing
6. **Quoted** - Quote generated, awaiting broker acceptance
7. **BindRequested** - Broker requested to bind policy
8. **Bound** - Policy issued (terminal state)
9. **Declined** - Submission declined by underwriter (terminal state)
10. **Withdrawn** - Broker withdrew submission (terminal state)

**Allowed Transitions:**

| From State | To State(s) | Prerequisites | Authorization |
|------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Received | Triaging | None (automatic) | System |
| Triaging | WaitingOnBroker | Missing info documented | Distribution, Admin |
| Triaging | ReadyForUWReview | All required fields populated | Distribution, Admin |
| Triaging | Declined | Decline reason | Distribution, Admin |
| Triaging | Withdrawn | Withdrawal reason | Distribution, Admin |
| WaitingOnBroker | ReadyForUWReview | Missing info received | Distribution, Admin |
| WaitingOnBroker | Declined | Decline reason | Distribution, Admin |
| WaitingOnBroker | Withdrawn | Withdrawal reason | Distribution, Admin |
| ReadyForUWReview | InReview | Underwriter assigned | Underwriter, Admin |
| ReadyForUWReview | WaitingOnBroker | Additional info needed | Underwriter, Admin |
| ReadyForUWReview | Declined | Decline reason | Underwriter, Admin |

                      type: integer
```

### Query Optimization for 360 View

**EF Core Implementation (C#):**

```csharp
// BAD: N+1 query problem
var account = await context.Accounts.FindAsync(accountId);
var contacts = await context.Contacts.Where(c => c.AccountId == accountId).ToListAsync();
var policies = await context.Policies.Where(p => p.AccountId == accountId).ToListAsync();
// ... multiple separate queries

// GOOD: Single optimized query with eager loading
var account360 = await context.Accounts
    .Where(a => a.Id == accountId)
    .Include(a => a.Contacts.Where(c => c.DeletedAt == null))
    .Include(a => a.Policies.Where(p => p.Status == "Active"))
    .Include(a => a.Submissions.Where(s => s.Status != "Bound" && s.Status != "Declined"))
    .Select(a => new Account360Response
    {
        Account = new AccountDetail
        {
            Id = a.Id,
            Name = a.Name,
            AccountNumber = a.AccountNumber,
            // ... map only needed fields, avoid loading entire entity
        },
        Contacts = a.Contacts.Select(c => new ContactSummary
        {
            Id = c.Id,
            Name = c.FullName,
            Email = c.Email,
            Phone = c.Phone
        }).ToList(),
        Policies = a.Policies.Select(p => new PolicySummary
        {
            Id = p.Id,
            PolicyNumber = p.PolicyNumber,
            CoverageType = p.CoverageType,
            Premium = p.Premium,
            EffectiveDate = p.EffectiveDate,
            ExpirationDate = p.ExpirationDate
        }).ToList(),
        // ... project only needed fields
    })
    .AsSplitQuery() // Use split queries for multiple collections to avoid cartesian explosion
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use `.Select()` projection to load only needed fields (not entire entities)
- Use `.AsSplitQuery()` when including multiple collections to avoid cartesian explosion
- Filter related entities in `.Include()` to reduce payload size
- Use indexed columns in `.Where()` clauses
- Consider caching reference data (coverage types, states)

### Authorization for 360 View

**Casbin Policies:**

```csv
# Distribution users can view full 360 for all accounts
p, Distribution, Account, Read360, allow

# Underwriters can view 360 only for accounts with active submissions assigned to them
p, Underwriter, Account, Read360, allow, exists(sub.assignedSubmissions, s.accountId == res.id)

# Brokers can view 360 only for their own accounts (external portal)
p, Broker, Account, Read360, allow, res.brokerId == sub.brokerId

# Admins can view all
p, Admin, Account, Read360, allow
```

**Field-Level Security:**
- Internal notes: Visible only to Distribution, Underwriter, Admin (not Broker)
- Premium amounts: Visible to all
- Tax ID: Visible only to Admin

## Example 4: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Complete ADR examples showing architectural decision documentation.

### ADR-001: Modular Monolith vs Microservices

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

We need to decide on the service architecture for Nebula. The primary options are:
1. **Microservices**: Separate deployable services for Broker, Account, Submission, Renewal modules
2. **Modular Monolith**: Single deployable with logical module boundaries

**Factors to consider:**
- Team size: 3-5 developers initially
- Expected scale: 50-500 concurrent users in first year
- Deployment complexity: Limited DevOps resources initially
- Transaction boundaries: Many operations span multiple entities (e.g., create submission → update broker → log timeline)
- Development velocity: Need to ship MVP quickly

**Decision:**

We will implement a **Modular Monolith** architecture for Phase 0 and Phase 1.

**Rationale:**

Pros of Modular Monolith:
- **Simpler deployment**: Single Docker container, easier CI/CD
- **Easier transactions**: ACID transactions across modules (Broker + Submission in same DB transaction)
- **Faster development**: No network calls between modules, easier debugging
- **Lower operational complexity**: One database, one deployment, simpler monitoring
- **Team size appropriate**: Small team benefits from shared codebase

Cons of Modular Monolith:
- **Scaling limitations**: Must scale entire application (but not a concern at 50-500 users)
- **Technology coupling**: All modules use same tech stack (.NET) (acceptable given expertise)

Cons of Microservices (which we're avoiding):
- **Operational overhead**: Multiple deployments, service discovery, distributed tracing
- **Transaction complexity**: Distributed transactions, saga patterns, eventual consistency
- **Development overhead**: API versioning, inter-service communication, testing complexity
- **Team overhead**: Requires more DevOps expertise and tooling

**Consequences:**

- All modules (Broker, Account, Submission, Renewal, Timeline, Identity) deployed as one .NET application
- Logical module boundaries enforced via folder structure and namespaces
- Shared database (PostgreSQL) with tables organized by module
- Future migration path: If scaling requires, can extract modules to microservices (design interfaces as if they were separate services)
- Clear interfaces between modules to enable future decomposition

**Review Date:** 2027-01-31 (after 1 year of production usage)

### ADR-002: EF Core as ORM

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

We need an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for the .NET backend. Options considered:
1. **Entity Framework Core 10**: Microsoft's official ORM
2. **Dapper**: Lightweight micro-ORM (SQL-first)
3. **NHibernate**: Mature ORM alternative

**Decision:**

Use **Entity Framework Core 10** as the primary ORM.

**Rationale:**

Pros of EF Core:
- **Code-first migrations**: Easy schema evolution and version control
- **LINQ support**: Strongly-typed queries, compile-time safety
- **Change tracking**: Automatic audit field updates (UpdatedAt, UpdatedBy)
- **Navigation properties**: Easy relationship traversal
- **Microsoft support**: Official support, regular updates, .NET 10 compatibility
- **Ecosystem**: Good tooling, documentation, community

Cons of EF Core:
- **Performance overhead**: Slightly slower than Dapper for read-heavy scenarios
- **Learning curve**: Complex for advanced scenarios (owned entities, TPH, query filters)

Why not Dapper:
- More boilerplate code for CRUD operations
- No change tracking (manual UpdatedAt, UpdatedBy management)
- No migration support (would need FluentMigrator or manual SQL scripts)
- Better for read-heavy, report-style queries (which we can use alongside EF Core)

Why not NHibernate:
- Less active development compared to EF Core
- Smaller community and fewer resources
- Configuration complexity (XML or fluent API)

**Consequences:**

- All entity classes inherit from `BaseEntity` (Id, timestamps, audit fields)
- Migrations managed via `dotnet ef migrations` commands
- Use `.AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries (performance optimization)
- Use Dapper for complex reporting queries where EF Core is suboptimal
- Global query filters for soft delete (WHERE DeletedAt IS NULL)

**Performance Mitigation:**
- Use projections (`.Select()`) to load only needed fields
- Use `.AsSplitQuery()` for multiple included collections
- Use `.AsNoTracking()` for read-only operations
- Consider read replicas for heavy reporting

### ADR-003: Casbin for ABAC Authorization

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

We need fine-grained authorization that supports:
- Role-based access (Admin, Distribution, Underwriter)
- Resource-based access (user can update submissions assigned to them)
- Attribute-based access (user can view accounts in their region)

Options:
1. **Casbin (ABAC)**: Policy-based authorization framework
2. **Custom RBAC**: Hand-rolled role checks in code
3. **Azure AD / Keycloak built-in**: RBAC via JWT claims

**Decision:**

Use **Casbin with ABAC model** for authorization.

**Rationale:**

Pros of Casbin:
- **Policy-based**: Policies external to code, can be updated without deployment
- **ABAC support**: Can check resource attributes (submission.assignedUnderwriter == user.id)
- **Auditable**: All policies defined in CSV or database, easy to review
- **Testable**: Policies can be unit-tested independently
- **Flexible**: Supports RBAC, ABAC, and hybrid models

Why not custom RBAC:
- Hard-coded role checks scattered in code (`if (user.Role == "Admin")`)
- Hard to audit all authorization logic
- Difficult to add fine-grained rules (attribute-based)

Why not Keycloak-only:
- Keycloak provides authentication and basic RBAC via roles
- Cannot check resource attributes (e.g., "assigned underwriter") in Keycloak
- Would need custom code anyway for fine-grained checks

**Consequences:**

- Casbin policies stored in database (NebulaDbContext)
- Middleware enforces authorization on every API request
- Subject attributes extracted from JWT (roles, userId, region)
- Resource attributes extracted from entity (status, assignedUnderwriter, brokerId)
- Policy format: `p, {role}, {resource}, {action}, {effect}, {condition}`
- Example: `p, Underwriter, Submission, Update, allow, sub.userId == res.assignedUnderwriter`

**Integration:**
- Keycloak for authentication (OIDC/JWT)
- Casbin for authorization (ABAC policies)
- UserProfile table maps Keycloak user to Nebula attributes (region, roles)
