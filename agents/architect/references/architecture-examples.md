## Example 1: E-commerce Order Management System

### Order Entity Specification

**Table Name:** `Orders`

**Description:** Represents a customer order with line items.

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints | Default | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Id | Guid | PK, NOT NULL | NewGuid() | Unique identifier |
| OrderNumber | string(50) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | - | Human-readable order number (ORD-2026-001234) |
| CustomerId | Guid | FK → Customers, NOT NULL | - | Customer who placed order |
| Status | string(20) | NOT NULL | 'Pending' | Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled |
| OrderDate | DateTime | NOT NULL | UtcNow | When order was placed |
| TotalAmount | decimal(18,2) | NOT NULL | - | Order total (sum of line items) |
| ShippingAddress | string(500) | NOT NULL | - | Delivery address |
| PaymentMethod | string(50) | NOT NULL | - | CreditCard, PayPal, BankTransfer |
| PaymentStatus | string(20) | NOT NULL | 'Pending' | Pending, Paid, Refunded |
| CreatedAt | DateTime | NOT NULL | UtcNow | UTC timestamp |
| CreatedBy | Guid | NOT NULL | - | System or user who created |
| UpdatedAt | DateTime | NOT NULL | UtcNow | UTC timestamp |
| UpdatedBy | Guid | NOT NULL | - | User who last updated |

#### Relationships

- **One-to-Many:** Order → OrderItems (cascade delete)
- **Many-to-One:** Order → Customer (restrict delete if orders exist)

#### Indexes

- `IX_Orders_OrderNumber` (UNIQUE)
- `IX_Orders_CustomerId`
- `IX_Orders_Status`
- `IX_Orders_OrderDate`

#### Audit Requirements

- All mutations create `ActivityTimelineEvent`
- Events: OrderCreated, OrderStatusChanged, OrderCancelled
- Timeline includes before/after state for updates

### Order Workflow State Machine

**States:**
- Pending (initial) → Processing → Shipped → Delivered (terminal)
- Pending → Cancelled (terminal)

**Allowed Transitions:**

| From | To | Prerequisites | Authorization |
|------|----|---------------|---------------|
| Pending | Processing | Payment confirmed | System, Admin |
| Processing | Shipped | Items picked, label generated | WarehouseStaff, Admin |
| Shipped | Delivered | Carrier confirms delivery | System |
| Pending | Cancelled | No payment or customer request | Customer, Admin |
| Processing | Cancelled | Customer request before shipment | Admin only |

**Validation Rules:**

**Processing → Shipped:**
- All order items must be picked
- Shipping label must be generated
- Carrier tracking number must exist

**Error Responses:**

```json
{
  "code": "INVALID_TRANSITION",
  "message": "Cannot ship order. Items not yet picked.",
  "details": {
    "currentStatus": "Processing",
    "attemptedStatus": "Shipped",
    "missingRequirements": ["Items not picked"]
  }
}
```

### Order API Contract

                paymentMethod:
                  type: string
                  enum: [CreditCard, PayPal, BankTransfer]
      responses:

        '400':
          description: Validation error
        '402':
          description: Payment required
        '409':
          description: Inventory conflict (out of stock)

  /api/orders/{id}/status:
    put:
      summary: Update order status
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
            format: uuid
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:

              properties:
                status:
                  type: string
                  enum: [Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled]
                trackingNumber:
                  type: string
                  description: Required when transitioning to Shipped
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Status updated successfully
        '409':
          description: Invalid status transition
```

### Authorization Policies

**Casbin Policies:**

```
# Customers can create orders and view their own orders
p, Customer, Order, Create, allow
p, Customer, Order, Read, allow, sub.userId == res.customerId

# WarehouseStaff can update order status (Processing → Shipped)
p, WarehouseStaff, Order, Update, allow, res.status in ["Processing", "Shipped"]

# Admins can do everything
p, Admin, Order, *, allow
```

## How to Use These Examples

1. Select a domain relevant to your solution (or create your own)
2. Follow the structure (Entity → Workflow → API → Authorization)
3. Adapt field names and relationships to your domain
4. Keep patterns consistent across all entities in your system
5. Reference these examples when designing new modules
