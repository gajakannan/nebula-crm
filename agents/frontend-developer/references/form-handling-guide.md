# Form Handling Guide

Generic guidance for form state, validation, and submission.

## Best Practices

- Validate on blur or submit
- Show inline errors near fields
- Disable submit during async requests
- Preserve user input on errors

## Schema Validation

Use a schema validation library when possible to keep validation centralized.
