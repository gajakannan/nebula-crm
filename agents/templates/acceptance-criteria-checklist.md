# Acceptance Criteria Checklist

Use this checklist to validate that acceptance criteria are clear, testable, and domain-neutral.

## 1) Clarity & Testability

- [ ] Each criterion is specific and measurable
- [ ] No vague terms ("properly", "fast", "user-friendly")
- [ ] Pass/fail is unambiguous

**Bad:** The system should handle record creation properly
**Good:** Given valid input, when I submit, then a new record appears in the list

## 2) Coverage

- [ ] Happy path covered
- [ ] At least one error/edge case covered
- [ ] Permission/authorization behavior specified (if relevant)
- [ ] Role-based visibility is per-role exhaustive (for each role, what can they see/do — not just "authorized users only")

## 3) Data Validation

- [ ] Required fields enforced
- [ ] Formats and constraints specified
- [ ] Duplicates/conflicts handled (if applicable)

## 4) Error Handling

- [ ] Error messages are actionable
- [ ] System errors have a user-safe message

## 5) Navigation & Feedback

- [ ] Post-action navigation specified
- [ ] Success/failure feedback specified

## 6) Non-Functional Criteria (If Applicable)

- [ ] Performance expectations
- [ ] Security expectations
- [ ] Reliability expectations

## 7) Audit & Timeline (If Applicable)

- [ ] Every mutation specifies which timeline event type(s) it produces (e.g., `EntityCreated`, `EntityUpdated`)
- [ ] Event payload structure defined or referenced (what data is captured in the event)
- [ ] Event description template specified (human-readable text rendered at write time)
- [ ] Append-only semantics confirmed for workflow transitions (if applicable)

## 8) Out of Scope

- [ ] Explicit non-goals listed
