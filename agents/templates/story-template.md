# User Story Template

Use this template for all user stories to ensure consistency and completeness. Keep it domain-neutral; project-specific examples live in `planning-mds/examples/`.

One story per file. Story files are colocated in their feature folder at `planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/`.

Filename convention: `F{NNNN}-S{NNNN}-{slug}.md` (e.g., `F0001-S0001-create-record.md`).
Non-story docs in feature folders must not start with `F{NNNN}-S{NNNN}` to avoid story-index drift (for example: use `ASSEMBLY-PLAN-F0001-S0001.md`).
The `Story ID` value must match the filename prefix exactly.

## Story Header

**Story ID:** [F0001-S0001, F0001-S0002, ...]
**Feature:** [F0001 — Feature Name]
**Title:** [Short descriptive title]
**Priority:** [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
**Phase:** [MVP | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Infrastructure | Future]

## User Story

**As a** [specific persona]
**I want** [capability]
**So that** [business value]

## Context & Background

[Why this story exists and what it unlocks]

## Acceptance Criteria

Use Given/When/Then or a checklist. Be specific and testable.

**Happy Path:**
- **Given** [context]
- **When** [action]
- **Then** [expected outcome]

**Alternative Flows / Edge Cases:**
- [Scenario] → [Expected behavior]

**Checklist (if simpler):**
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]

## Data Requirements

**Required Fields:**
- [Field]: [Purpose]

**Optional Fields:**
- [Field]: [Purpose]

**Validation Rules:**
- [Rule]

## Role-Based Visibility

**Roles that can [action]:**
- [Role] — [Permission]

**Data Visibility:**
- InternalOnly content: [What's internal]
- ExternalVisible content: [What external users can see]

## Non-Functional Expectations (If Applicable)

- Performance: [e.g., page loads < 2s]
- Security: [e.g., authorized users only]
- Reliability: [e.g., error handling expectations]

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- [Story ID] — [Reason]

**Related Stories:**
- [Story ID] — [Relationship]

## Business Rules (Optional — include when story has domain constraints)

Explicit domain constraints, system behavior contracts, or platform-specific rules that are not obvious from the acceptance criteria. Number each rule for easy reference.

1. [Rule name:] [Description of the constraint and why it exists]
2. [Rule name:] [Description]

## Out of Scope

- [Explicit non-goal]
- [Deferred capability]

## UI/UX Notes (Optional)

- Screens involved: [Screen name(s)]
- Key interactions: [Summary]

## Questions & Assumptions

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] [Question requiring stakeholder input]

**Assumptions (to be validated):**
- [Assumption]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Permissions enforced
- [ ] Audit/timeline logged (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Story filename matches `Story ID` prefix (`F{NNNN}-S{NNNN}-...`)
- [ ] Story index regenerated if story file was added/renamed/moved

## Review Provenance

Story-level signoff provenance is recorded in the parent feature `STATUS.md` section:
- `Required Signoff Roles (Set in Planning)`
- `Story Signoff Provenance`

Minimum expected provenance roles for any completed story:
- `Quality Engineer`
- `Code Reviewer`

## Infrastructure / Non-Standard Story Guidance

Not all stories follow the typical entity → service → endpoint pattern. Infrastructure stories (DevOps scripts, CI workflows, tooling) are a valid variant. When writing infrastructure stories:

- The story template still applies — use all sections, but mark inapplicable ones (e.g., "Permissions enforced (N/A — CLI tooling, no server-side auth changes)").
- "Data Requirements" may describe script inputs/outputs rather than entity fields.
- "Role-Based Visibility" may describe who can execute the tool rather than ABAC policies.
- "Definition of Done" items like "Audit/timeline logged" may be N/A — state why.

## Example Library

See `planning-mds/examples/stories/` for project-specific story examples.
