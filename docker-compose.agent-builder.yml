    # Security note:
    # - This read-write mount is intentional for local development so the builder can
    #   generate and edit project artifacts directly in your workspace.
    # - For shared or production-like environments, prefer selective mounts or read-only
    #   mounts and an explicit output directory.
    # - The container runs as a non-root user (uid/gid 10001 in the image).
