# OWASP Top 10 Review Results (Pre‑Implementation)

Status: Complete (Pre‑Implementation)
Last Updated: 2026-02-22
Owner: Security + Architect

## Scope

Pre-implementation review based on planning artifacts, API contract, and architecture decisions.
This is not a code audit and must be re-run during implementation.
Implementation security evidence is tracked separately in `planning-mds/security/implementation-security-review.md`.

## Assessment Inputs

- planning-mds/INCEPTION.md
- planning-mds/api/nebula-api.yaml
- planning-mds/architecture/*
- planning-mds/security/*

## Findings Summary

| OWASP Category | Risk | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A01: Broken Access Control | High | Open | Requires finalized resource-action matrix and policy tests |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | Medium | Planned | Encryption-at-rest and in-transit requirements defined |
| A03: Injection | Medium | Planned | Schema validation + strict input rules required |
| A04: Insecure Design | Medium | Mitigated | Threat model and ADRs define controls |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | Medium | Open | Runtime hardening pending implementation |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | Medium | Open | Dependency scanning to be enforced in app CI |
| A07: Identification and Auth Failures | Medium | Planned | Keycloak + token validation strategy defined |
| A08: Software and Data Integrity | Medium | Planned | CI gating and artifact signing tracked in implementation security review |
| A09: Security Logging and Monitoring | Medium | Open | Logging/redaction policy to be finalized in implementation |
| A10: SSRF | Low | N/A | No server-side outbound fetch flows defined yet |

## Required Actions Before Implementation

- Finalize authorization policy artifacts and tests. **(Completed)**
- Define logging/redaction and monitoring strategy for runtime. **(Completed)**
- Enable dependency and container scans in application runtime CI. **(Completed)**
