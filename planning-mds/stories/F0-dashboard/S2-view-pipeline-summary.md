# S2: View Pipeline Summary (Mini-Kanban)

**Story ID:** S2
**Epic/Feature:** F0 — Dashboard
**Title:** View Pipeline Summary (Mini-Kanban)
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** MVP

## User Story

**As a** Distribution User or Underwriter
**I want** to see submission and renewal pipelines as horizontal status columns with counts and expandable card previews
**So that** I can identify bottlenecks at a glance and quickly drill into specific items without leaving the dashboard.

## Context & Background

Pipeline visibility is critical for distribution and underwriting teams. A traditional table of counts shows volume but lacks context. Inspired by Kanban-style boards (e.g., Copper Opportunities), this widget uses a mini-Kanban layout: horizontal status pills with counts that reveal a short card preview on hover or click. This gives users both the high-level funnel picture and quick access to individual items without navigating away.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Happy Path — Collapsed State (default):**
- **Given** the user is authenticated and on the Dashboard
- **When** the dashboard loads
- **Then** the Pipeline Summary widget displays two rows:
  - **Submissions row:** Horizontal sequence of status pills, one per non-terminal status (Received, Triaging, WaitingOnBroker, ReadyForUWReview, InReview, Quoted, BindRequested), each showing the status label and count badge. Scoped to user's authorization.
  - **Renewals row:** Horizontal sequence of status pills, one per non-terminal status (Created, Early, OutreachStarted, InReview, Quoted), each showing the status label and count badge. Scoped to user's authorization.
  - Pills are color-coded by workflow stage using the `ColorGroup` value from the reference status tables (see [data-model.md — Workflow Statuses](../../architecture/data-model.md)):

    | ColorGroup | Tailwind Color | Hex (bg/text) | Meaning | Statuses |
    |------------|---------------|---------------|---------|----------|
    | `intake` | slate | `bg-slate-100 text-slate-700` | New / just arrived | Received, Created, Early |
    | `triage` | blue | `bg-blue-100 text-blue-700` | Being sorted / assessed | Triaging |
    | `waiting` | amber | `bg-amber-100 text-amber-700` | Blocked on external action | WaitingOnBroker, OutreachStarted |
    | `review` | violet | `bg-violet-100 text-violet-700` | Under active review | ReadyForUWReview, InReview |
    | `decision` | emerald | `bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-700` | Near completion | Quoted, BindRequested |
  - A connecting line or arrow between pills conveys left-to-right flow.

**Expanded State (hover/click on a pill):**
- **Given** the user hovers over or clicks a status pill (e.g., "InReview: 7")
- **When** the expansion triggers
- **Then** a dropdown/popover appears below the pill showing up to 5 mini-cards for that status:
  - Each mini-card shows: entity name (Account or Broker name), amount or premium estimate (if Submission), days in current status, and assigned user avatar/initials
  - A "View all N" link at the bottom of the popover navigates to the filtered Submission List or Renewal List

**Click-Through Navigation:**
- **Given** the user clicks a mini-card within the expanded popover
- **When** the click is processed
- **Then** the user is navigated to the Submission or Renewal detail view for that entity

- **Given** the user clicks the "View all N" link
- **When** the click is processed
- **Then** the user is navigated to the Submission List or Renewal List screen, pre-filtered to that status

**Edge Cases:**
- No submissions exist → Submissions row shows all status pills with count "0"; expansion shows "No submissions in this stage"
- No renewals exist → Renewals row shows all status pills with count "0"
- User has restricted scope → Counts and mini-cards reflect only authorized entities
- A status has 0 items → Display the pill with "0" count (do not hide); expansion shows empty state message
- More than 5 items in a status → Show top 5 sorted by days-in-status descending (longest first) plus "View all N" link
- Popover extends beyond viewport edge → Reposition to stay within viewport bounds

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Submissions displayed as horizontal status pills with counts
- [ ] Renewals displayed as horizontal status pills with counts
- [ ] Pills are color-coded by workflow stage
- [ ] Hover/click expands pill to show up to 5 mini-cards
- [ ] Mini-cards show: entity name, amount, days in status, assigned user
- [ ] "View all N" link navigates to filtered list
- [ ] Mini-card click navigates to entity detail
- [ ] Zero-count pills are visible (not hidden)
- [ ] Widget loads within the overall dashboard p95 < 2s target
- [ ] Popover loads within 300ms of interaction
- [ ] Authorization check: counts and mini-cards are filtered by authenticated user permissions (ABAC)
- [ ] Audit/timeline requirement: N/A (read-only view with no mutation)

## Data Requirements

**Required Fields (per status pill):**
- StatusLabel: string (e.g., "InReview")
- Count: non-negative integer
- EntityType: "Submission" | "Renewal"
- ColorGroup: string (one of `intake`, `triage`, `waiting`, `review`, `decision` — maps to Tailwind classes per the color mapping table in Acceptance Criteria)

**Required Fields (per mini-card, loaded on expand):**
- EntityId: uuid
- EntityName: string (Account name or Broker name)
- Amount: decimal | null (PremiumEstimate for Submissions; null for Renewals)
- DaysInStatus: integer (calendar days since last transition to current status)
- AssignedUserInitials: string (2 chars, from UserProfile)
- AssignedUserDisplayName: string (for tooltip)

**Validation Rules:**
- Counts must be non-negative integers
- Status labels must match the defined workflow statuses exactly
- Terminal statuses (Bound, Declined, Withdrawn, Lost, Lapsed) are excluded
- DaysInStatus must be non-negative; computed as (today - last WorkflowTransition.OccurredAt for this entity)
- Mini-cards sorted by DaysInStatus descending (items stuck longest appear first)

## Role-Based Visibility

**Roles that can view Pipeline Summary:**
- Distribution User — sees submissions/renewals scoped to their department/region
- Underwriter — sees submissions assigned to or accessible by them
- Relationship Manager — sees submissions/renewals linked to their broker relationships
- Program Manager — sees submissions/renewals within their programs
- Admin — sees all (unscoped)

**Data Visibility:**
- All pipeline data is InternalOnly.

## Non-Functional Expectations

- Performance: Status pills with counts must render within the overall dashboard p95 < 2s target. Mini-card popover data must load within 300ms (p95) after user interaction (lazy-loaded, not pre-fetched).
- Security: Backend must enforce Casbin ABAC scope before aggregating counts and returning mini-card data
- Reliability: If count query fails, display "Unable to load pipeline data" and log the error; do not block other widgets. If mini-card query fails, show "Unable to load details" in the popover.

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- Submission entity with CurrentStatus field and workflow status values
- Renewal entity with CurrentStatus field and workflow status values
- WorkflowTransition entity (for computing DaysInStatus)
- UserProfile entity (for assigned user initials)
- ~~Submission List / Renewal List screens (for "View all" navigation)~~ — Not in F0/F1 scope; links hidden per MVP Navigation Constraints
- ~~Submission / Renewal detail screens (for mini-card click-through)~~ — Not in F0/F1 scope; entity names render as plain text per MVP Navigation Constraints

**Related Stories:**
- S1 — KPI Cards (complementary high-level metrics)
- F3 — Submission Intake Workflow (provides submission data)
- F4 — Renewal Pipeline (provides renewal data)

## Out of Scope

- Full Kanban board with drag-and-drop status transitions (Future)
- Filtering by date range within the widget
- Historical trend comparison (e.g., this week vs last week)
- Terminal status counts (Bound, Declined, etc.)
- Inline editing of submission/renewal from mini-cards

## UI/UX Notes

- Screens involved: Dashboard
- Layout: Two horizontal rows — "Submissions" label + pills on top, "Renewals" label + pills below
- Each pill: rounded rectangle with status label + count badge; color-coded background
- Pills connected by subtle arrows or lines to show flow direction (left to right)
- Expanded popover: appears below the pill, shadowed card with mini-card list
- Mini-card: compact single row — entity name (bold), amount (right-aligned), days-in-status chip (e.g., "12d"), user avatar circle
- Responsive: on narrow viewports, pills wrap to multiple rows; popover becomes full-width overlay
- Color palette: 5 `ColorGroup` categories — `intake` (slate), `triage` (blue), `waiting` (amber), `review` (violet), `decision` (emerald); see mapping table in Acceptance Criteria above

## Questions & Assumptions

**Assumptions:**
- Only non-terminal statuses are shown (terminal statuses are excluded)
- Mini-cards are lazy-loaded on hover/click (not pre-fetched) to keep initial dashboard load fast
- 5 mini-cards per popover is sufficient; users needing more use the "View all" link
- DaysInStatus is computed from the most recent WorkflowTransition for that entity

**MVP Navigation Constraints (confirmed):**
- Submission List, Renewal List, Submission Detail, and Renewal Detail screens are not in F0/F1 scope.
- "View all N" links are hidden (not rendered) until target list screens exist.
- Mini-card entity names render as plain text (not clickable) until target detail screens exist.
- See [feature-assembly-plan.md — MVP Navigation Constraints](../../architecture/feature-assembly-plan.md) for full degradation rules.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Edge cases handled (zero data, restricted scope, query failure, popover positioning)
- [ ] Permissions enforced (Casbin ABAC scope filtering)
- [ ] Audit/timeline logged: N/A (read-only)
- [ ] Tests pass (unit test for pill rendering and grouping, integration test for scoped counts and mini-card queries)
- [ ] Click-through navigation works for available list and detail screens
- [ ] Accessible: pills are keyboard-navigable (Tab + Enter/Space to expand), popover has role="dialog" with aria-label
