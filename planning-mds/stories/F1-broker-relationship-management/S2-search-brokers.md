# Story: Search Brokers

**Story ID:** S2
**Epic/Feature:** F1 - Broker Relationship Management
**Title:** Search brokers by name or license number
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** MVP

## User Story

**As a** Distribution Manager
**I want** to search brokers by name or license
**So that** I can quickly locate a broker without paging through the full list

## Context & Background

As broker volume grows, list-only browsing becomes inefficient. Search is needed for daily relationship workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** the broker list has multiple records
- **When** I enter a partial broker name
- **Then** matching brokers are returned using case-insensitive filtering

- **Given** I enter an exact license number
- **When** search executes
- **Then** the matching broker is returned as the top result

- **Given** no records match the query
- **When** search executes
- **Then** I see an empty-state message and clear-search action

- **Given** an unauthorized user calls the search endpoint
- **When** authorization is evaluated
- **Then** access is denied

- Error scenario: query strings over max length return a validation error
- Edge case: leading/trailing spaces are trimmed before search evaluation

## Data Requirements

**Required Fields:**
- Query: 1-100 chars after trimming

**Optional Fields:**
- Status filter: Active/Inactive

**Validation Rules:**
- Query must be sanitized before persistence/logging
- Query length must not exceed 100 chars
- License number search is exact match only in MVP (no partial license search)

## Role-Based Visibility

**Roles that can search brokers:**
- DistributionManager — full broker search
- RelationshipManager — full broker search
- Admin — full broker search

**Data Visibility:**
- InternalOnly content: inactive/hidden broker flags
- ExternalVisible content: none in MVP

## Non-Functional Expectations

- Performance: search response p95 < 300ms for 10k broker records
- Security: authorized roles only; no wildcard cross-tenant reads
- Reliability: empty results should not be treated as system failure

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- S1 - Broker records can be created
- Indexed broker search fields (name, license)

**Related Stories:**
- S3 - Broker list screen pagination

## Out of Scope

- Advanced search (multi-field boolean filters)
- Saved searches
- External broker self-service search

## Questions & Assumptions

**Assumptions (to be validated):**
- Name search is case-insensitive substring match

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Edge case and error scenario tests pass
- [ ] Authorization enforced for API and UI entry points
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass
